# Nostagia-Project-on-PHP
The Nostalgia Project is a project which makes people make them to ruminate about his /her past via photography, and video in a collaborative work between musicians, artists, computer scientists, and the general public. It draws upon web-based photo sharing, mobile communication, to explore the notion of nostalgia, merging the visual image with memories both responding to and affecting the other.
